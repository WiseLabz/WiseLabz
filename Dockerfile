# base in stage 3.

# "nonroot" UID/GID (65532:65532). distroless/static has no shell to mkdir
# or chown, so this has to happen in the (shell-having) builder stage and be
# copied in; Docker also uses an existing image-layer directory's ownership
# as the template when a volume is later mounted at the same path, which is
# what makes `docker run -v data:/data` work out of the box for the default
# file:/data/wiselabz.db DSN.
