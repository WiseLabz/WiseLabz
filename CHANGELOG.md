# Changelog

## Unreleased

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* **api:** `PATCH /connectors/{id}` has been removed. It was an undocumented
  alias of `PUT /connectors/{id}`, kept for clients predating the OpenAPI
  contract; use `PUT` instead. The generated frontend client has always been
  PUT-only, so no shipped client is affected.
* **api:** the `details` field of the `Error` envelope is now an array of
  `{ field, msg }` objects instead of a free-form object. Nothing had ever
  populated it, so no client can have depended on the previous shape.
