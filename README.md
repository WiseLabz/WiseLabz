# WiseLabz

**Automated documentation for your homelab.**

WiseLabz is a self-hosted, open-source service that automatically generates and maintains
documentation for your home lab. Register your services, Proxmox, Docker/Portainer,
pfSense/OPNsense, and more. Connect their APIs, and WiseLabz fetches live data to produce
structured, readable documentation from configurable templates. A diff engine detects
changes since the last sync and either triggers an AI-assisted section update or surfaces
an alert so nothing drifts undocumented. A web dashboard gives you a live view of your
services alongside the generated docs.

## Features

- **Multi-service connectors** — Built-in support for Proxmox, Docker/Portainer, and
  pfSense/OPNsense. Pull live configuration and state from each service via their native
  APIs.
- **Template-driven documentation** — Define what your docs look like with configurable
  templates. Control which sections appear, how data is formatted, and what detail level
  you get.
- **Change-aware diff engine** — WiseLabz compares each sync against the previous snapshot.
  When something changes, it either updates the relevant doc section automatically or
  flags it for review.
- **AI-assisted updates** — When a service change is detected, WiseLabz can draft the
  updated documentation section for you, keeping manual effort near zero.
- **Web dashboard** — Browse your generated documentation and monitor live service data
  side by side in one place.
- **Community connectors** — The connector interface is open. Anyone can write and
  contribute a connector for a service they rely on.
- **Single binary, single compose file** — Deploy with `docker compose up`. SQLite for
  small labs, PostgreSQL when you need it.

## Quick start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/WiseLabz/WiseLabz.git
cd WiseLabz

# Copy and edit the configuration
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml — add at least one service connection

# Start everything
docker compose up -d
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` and register your first service. A `config.example.yaml`
file is included in the repository root with commented examples for every supported
service.

## Configuration

WiseLabz reads settings from a `config.yaml` file at the repository root. Every key in
the YAML file can be overridden with an environment variable prefixed with `WISELABZ_`.
Environment variables always take precedence over the file, so you can keep secrets out of
your config file and tune settings per deployment without editing YAML.

```yaml
# config.yaml
server:
  port: 8080

database:
  driver: sqlite                # or "postgres"
  dsn: ./data/wiselabz.db

services:
  - name: home-proxmox
    type: proxmox
    url: https://192.168.1.10:8006
    # token_id and token_secret are read from env:
    #   WISELABZ_SERVICES_0_TOKEN_ID
    #   WISELABZ_SERVICES_0_TOKEN_SECRET
```

For a full list of configuration keys, see `config.example.yaml`.

## Supported services

| Service            | Status               |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Proxmox VE         | Built-in             |
| Docker / Portainer | Built-in             |
| pfSense / OPNsense | Built-in             |
| Everything else    | Community connectors |

New service connectors are community-driven. If the service you run isn't here yet,
[request it][connector-request] or build it yourself, the connector interface is
straightforward and well-documented.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Whether it's a bug report, a new connector, or a docs fix,
