# Offline Lab Book and Scheduled Doc Export

Writes every active doc to a local directory as Markdown on a schedule,
so documentation survives outside the tool — and doubles as a lightweight,
human-readable secondary backup alongside the ZIP archive described in
[BACKUP.md](BACKUP.md). Optionally, the directory is a clone of a Git
remote and every run commits and pushes the changes, giving the docs a real
Git history outside WiseLabz. Implemented in `backend/internal/docexport/`.

This is distinct from `GET /api/system/backup/export` (a single JSON bundle
meant for restoring into another WiseLabz instance): doc export writes one
`.md` file per doc, using exactly the content the doc engine already
generates and persists (`store.DocRecord.Content`) — no re-rendering.
Export strips `<!-- wl:gen … -->` ownership markers, preserving the rendered
content. Doc-owned `attachment:<id>` links become relative
`attachments/<sha256>.<ext>` paths; extensions follow sniffed MIME types.

## Download an offline Lab Book

The Docs page offers **Export Lab Book** to every signed-in user. Choose offline
HTML or Markdown zip. The authenticated API is
`GET /api/docs/export?format=html|md.zip`; it downloads a dated
`lab-book-YYYY-MM-DD.<format>` file containing only active docs the caller may
view. Human lab notes are visible to all users; generated lab inventory requires
instance admin, and connector docs require the existing viewer grant.

HTML contains a hierarchy-based table of contents, GFM tables, inline images,
CSS and Mermaid 12.0.0. Open it with the network disabled: diagrams render in the
browser without fetching a bundle. Use the browser print command and **Save as
PDF** for a PDF copy. PDF/text attachments are listed by filename rather than
embedded. Remote images are omitted, and raw HTML is omitted for offline safety.
The Markdown zip stores hierarchy folders with `index.md`, title/connector front
matter, relative doc links and attachments, and can be imported with the
Markdown/Obsidian importer.

Scheduled reports can attach an HTML Lab Book to email and Discord; see
[REPORTS.md](REPORTS.md) for scope, channel configuration and size limits.

## Configuration

The scheduled directory/Git export remains config-file (or env) only; the
Lab Book download API does not change its configuration, matching the "quality"/"digest"/"backup-verify" scheduled jobs in
`cmd/server/main.go` rather than the schedule-via-API pattern used for the
primary backup job.

The server refuses to start (`server config validate` reports it) when the
Git settings are inconsistent: a scheme other than https/ssh, credentials
embedded in the remote URL, a token together with any `ssh_*` setting, an SSH
remote without `ssh_key_path`, or an SSH remote without `ssh_known_hosts`
while `insecure_skip_host_key` is off.

## Behavior

- Each run writes one file per doc, named `<slugified-title>-<first 8 chars
  of doc ID>.md`, to `dir` (local mode) or `dir/<git.path>` (Git mode), and
  mirrors that directory to the current set of docs.
- **Safe prune:** only files matching the generated name pattern
  (`<slug>-<8 hex>.md`, or `<uuid>.md` for the rare collision fallback) are
  ever deleted, so a `README.md` or any other hand-written file next to the
  export survives every run, in both modes.
- The directory is created if it doesn't exist.
- Failures are logged and skip that run; they don't crash the server (same
  convention as the other scheduled jobs).

## Git mode

The Git implementation is pure Go (`go-git`), because the runtime image is
`distroless/static` and has no `git` binary.

**Workdir.** `doc_export.dir` is a persistent clone. If it's empty or
missing, the first run initialises it with `origin` set to the remote. If
it's non-empty, it must already be a Git repository whose `origin` URL is
exactly `doc_export.git.remote`; anything else makes the run fail rather
than touch a directory the exporter doesn't own.

**Each run:**

1. Fetch `origin/<branch>` and hard-reset the clone to it (untracked files
   are cleaned). An empty remote, or a missing branch, is fine: the first
   push creates it.
2. Export the docs into `<dir>/<path>` (with the safe prune above).
3. Stage additions, edits and removals under `<path>`. If nothing changed,
   no commit is made.
4. Commit once with the configured author, message
   `docs: export N docs (+added ~modified -removed)` and the per-kind file
   lists in the body.
5. Push `<branch>`, **never forced**.

**Divergence.** Because every run starts from `origin/<branch>`, commits
other people push to the same branch (a README, CI config, manual edits
outside the generated files) are kept. If the remote moves between the fetch
and the push, the push is rejected as non-fast-forward: the run is logged as
failed and simply retried on the next schedule, which fetches the new head
and rebuilds the export on top of it. Local unpushed commits are never kept
between runs; the export is always regenerated from the store.

**Per-revision history.** Set `commit_mode: per_revision` to replay retained
`doc_versions` rows as individual commits. The first run makes one bot-authored
snapshot and writes `<path>/.wiselabz-export.json` with each doc's revision and
filename. Later runs read that state after fetching and resetting to the
remote, commit revisions in creation order with message
`docs(<slug>): rev N (<trigger>)`, then push once. The revision creation time
becomes the Git author date; the configured bot is the committer. The state
file is committed with every revision and is safe from Markdown pruning.

By default, the bot is also the author. `author_from_user: true` exposes the
revision user's display name (or username) and email in the Git log. A user
without an email gets `<username>@users.noreply.wiselabz`; deleted or disabled
users and revisions without an author use the bot. Enable this only if that
identity exposure is acceptable for the remote repository.

At most `max_revisions_per_run` revisions are replayed per run. A capped run
leaves the remaining revisions for the next run and does not catch up the
snapshot. Once the cap is clear, a bot-authored snapshot commit covers deleted
docs, restores, and any drift. Retention may have pruned intermediate versions;
those cannot be replayed, and the catch-up commit restores the current head.
Rejected pushes are retried from the remote state on the next run.

**Authentication.**

- HTTPS: set `token` (e.g. a GitHub fine-grained PAT with *Contents:
  read and write* on the one repo). It's sent as basic auth with the user
  `x-access-token`. Traffic goes through the shared hardened HTTP client
  (`internal/httpx`: TLS 1.2+, no redirects); the transfer is bounded by the
  job's context rather than a fixed client timeout. Without a token, the
  remote must accept anonymous pushes.
- SSH: set `ssh_key_path` to an unencrypted private key and
  `ssh_known_hosts` to a known_hosts file containing the server's host key
  (e.g. `ssh-keyscan github.com > known_hosts`, then verify the fingerprint).
  The user comes from the URL (`git` if absent). `insecure_skip_host_key:
  true` disables host key verification entirely; it logs a WARN at startup
  and on every run and should only be used on a trusted network.

## Failure notifications

The scheduler records export run health in `job_health` (#384) and emits the
`system.job_failed` notification event on state transitions:

- severity `warning` when the job goes from OK to failing (e.g. a revoked
  token, an unreachable remote, a rejected push);
- severity `info` when it recovers.

Only these transitions notify, so a job that keeps failing sends one
notification, not one per run. Health is persisted in `job_health` across
server restarts. Route the event per channel under
**Settings → Notifications** (the `system job failed` row); it's also
included in digests.
