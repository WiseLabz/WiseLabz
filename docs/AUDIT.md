# Audit Trail

A record of who did what, and when, for the operator actions sensitive
enough to need attribution — connector changes and syncs, elevation,
auth settings changes, and document restores.

## Endpoint

`GET /api/system/audit` — instance-admin only (403 otherwise, `auth.RequireInstanceAdmin`; #240 replaced the flat operator/viewer role with per-connector grants), paginated
newest-first like other list endpoints (`page`, `pageSize`; see
`docs/openapi.yaml`'s `Page`/`PageSize` parameters). Optional filters:

- `action` — exact match, e.g. `connector.create`.
- `targetType` — exact match, e.g. `connector`, `doc`.

Response shape mirrors `ChangePage`/`AlertPage`: `{ items, total, page, pageSize }`.

### Keyset (cursor) pagination

Offset pagination re-counts and re-skips rows on every page, which gets
expensive as `audit_log` grows. Sending `cursor` opts into keyset pagination
instead: `?cursor=` for the first page, then the previous response's
`nextCursor` for each page after it. The server answers
`WHERE (created_at, id) < (cursor) ORDER BY created_at DESC, id DESC LIMIT
pageSize`, which reads straight out of an index (migration 000033) and cannot
skip or repeat a row when several records share a `created_at`.

The cursor is opaque — never build one client-side. `nextCursor` is absent on
the last page and on requests that did not send `cursor`, so offset clients see
the unchanged four-key envelope. While a cursor is in use `page` is ignored;
`total` still reports the full filtered count.

`GET /api/changes` and `GET /api/connectors/{id}/syncs` take the same `cursor`
parameter. Since the sync-run response body is a bare array, its cursor comes
back in the `X-Next-Cursor` response header rather than an envelope field.

## What's recorded

Each entry (`AuditRecord` in `docs/openapi.yaml`) has: `actorUserId`,
`actorRole`, `action`, `targetType`, `targetId`, `detail` (a small JSON
object, action-specific), and `createdAt`.

| `alert.resolve` | `POST /api/alerts/{id}/resolve` | alert / id |
| `alert.dismiss` | `POST /api/alerts/{id}/dismiss` | alert / id |
| `alert.snooze` | `POST /api/alerts/{id}/snooze` | alert / id |
| `finding.resolve` | `POST /api/findings/{id}/resolve` | finding / id |
| `compliance_rule.create` | `POST /api/compliance/rules` | compliance_rule / new ID |
| `compliance_rule.update` | `PUT /api/compliance/rules/{id}` | compliance_rule / id |
| `compliance_rule.delete` | `DELETE /api/compliance/rules/{id}` | compliance_rule / id |

| `compliance_rule.disable` | `PUT /api/compliance/rules/{id}` (enabled false) | compliance_rule / id |

`detail` never carries secret values. `connector.update` and
`auth.config.update` record which *fields* changed (a name list), not
their values — connector config can hold credentials, and this keeps the
audit log safe to expose to any instance admin without redaction logic.
`connector.configPush` follows the same discipline: `detail` records the
pushed `fieldKey` (name) and `entityRef`, never the pushed `value`.

## What's not recorded

- **Failed attempts, except elevation denials.** An audit entry is written
  only after the action itself succeeds. A failed create/update/delete never
  reaches the audit log — this is a deliberate scope cut: this endpoint
  answers "what happened," not "what was attempted." Elevation-token denials
  are the exception because they are security-relevant attempts.
- **Reads.** Listing or viewing a resource is not an audited action. Downloading
  a snapshot diff with `format` is the exception; viewing the same diff as JSON
  without `format` is not audited.
- A write to the audit log failing is logged (`slog.Error`) but never
  fails the request — the audited action has already gone through by
  that point, so refusing the response would be misleading.

## Retention

Audit rows are not touched by the retention policies in
`backend/internal/store/retention.go` — they're kept indefinitely, since
their purpose is historical accountability rather than operational data. The
elevation request/denial rows inherit the same exemption through `audit_log`.
