# Audit Trail

A record of who did what, and when, for the operator actions sensitive
enough to need attribution — connector changes and syncs, elevation,
auth settings changes, and document restores.

## Endpoint

`GET /api/system/audit` — operator-only (403 for `viewer`), paginated
newest-first like other list endpoints (`page`, `pageSize`; see
`docs/openapi.yaml`'s `Page`/`PageSize` parameters). Optional filters:

- `action` — exact match, e.g. `connector.create`.
- `targetType` — exact match, e.g. `connector`, `doc`.

Response shape mirrors `ChangePage`/`AlertPage`: `{ items, total, page, pageSize }`.

## What's recorded

Each entry (`AuditRecord` in `docs/openapi.yaml`) has: `actorUserId`,
`actorRole`, `action`, `targetType`, `targetId`, `detail` (a small JSON
object, action-specific), and `createdAt`.

| Action | Trigger | targetType / targetId |
|---|---|---|
| `connector.create` | `POST /api/connectors` | connector / new ID |
| `connector.update` | `PUT /api/connectors/{id}` | connector / id |
| `connector.delete` | `DELETE /api/connectors/{id}` | connector / id |
| `connector.toggle_enabled` | `PUT /api/connectors/{id}/enabled` | connector / id |
| `connector.sync` | `POST /api/connectors/{id}/sync` | connector / id |
| `connector.sync_all` | `POST /api/sync` | connector / (none) |
| `auth.elevate` | `POST /api/auth/elevate` | action / the elevated action name |
| `auth.config.update` | `PUT /api/auth/config` | auth_config / (none) |
| `auth.provider.enabled` | `PUT /api/auth/providers/{id}/enabled` | oidc_provider / provider id |
| `doc.restore` | `POST /api/docs/{id}/versions/{rev}/restore` | doc / doc id |
| `change.ack` | `POST /api/changes/{id}/ack` | change / id |
| `change.dismiss` | `POST /api/changes/{id}/dismiss` | change / id |
| `change.bulk_ack` | `POST /api/changes/bulk-resolve` (`status: acknowledged`) | change / id — one record per resolved item |
| `change.bulk_dismiss` | `POST /api/changes/bulk-resolve` (`status: dismissed`) | change / id — one record per resolved item |

`detail` never carries secret values. `connector.update` and
`auth.config.update` record which *fields* changed (a name list), not
their values — connector config can hold credentials, and this keeps the
audit log safe to expose to any operator without redaction logic.

## What's not recorded

- **Failed attempts.** An audit entry is written only after the action
  itself succeeds. A failed create/update/delete never reaches the
  audit log — this is a deliberate scope cut: this endpoint answers "what
  happened," not "what was attempted." Add failure logging separately
  (e.g. to the request logger) if that becomes a need.
- **Reads.** Listing or viewing a resource is not an audited action.
- A write to the audit log failing is logged (`slog.Error`) but never
  fails the request — the audited action has already gone through by
  that point, so refusing the response would be misleading.

## Retention

Audit rows are not touched by the retention policies in
`backend/internal/store/retention.go` — they're kept indefinitely, since
their purpose is historical accountability rather than operational data.
